# WorkIn
Corporate environments often rely on static, one-size-fits-all settings that fail to adapt to the dynamic needs of employees, leading to reduced comfort and productivity. This creates a gap between the occupants' actual needs and the building's rigid environmental controls. We propose 'WorkIn', an intelligent system that closes this gap by creating a proactive, user-centric workspace.

WorkIn operates on a hybrid data model that merges explicit user preferences with real-time, non-invasive sensing. Employees can voluntarily and anonymously submit personal comfort profiles (e.g., ideal temperature, allergy sensitivities) via a simple app, giving the system clear optimization goals. Concurrently, a network of privacy-respecting sensors, including mmWave radar for presence detection and CO2 monitors for air quality, assesses the environment's actual state without collecting personal data.

A core Reinforcement Learning (RL) AI processes this combined data, learning to dynamically balance the often-conflicting needs of multiple individuals. The system moves beyond finding a simple average, instead seeking the optimal setting that minimizes collective discomfort. By integrating with IoT platforms like LG ThinQ, WorkIn orchestrates a full suite of smart appliances, managing not only HVAC and lighting but also air purifiers, dehumidifiers, and even scheduling noisy appliances for non-disruptive times. For the corporation, WorkIn promises significant energy efficiency and operational intelligence, while for employees, it offers a new level of personalized comfort and satisfaction, allowing them to better focus on their work.
