\begin{abstract}
‘PocketHome’ is an AI-based automated control system that creates an optimal environment for multiple people at once. It works by combining user preferences, observed behaviors, and real-time environmental data from sensors in the space. Using this information, the system automatically adjusts shared appliances like heating/cooling systems, air purifiers, and lighting. The AI's main task is to find a balance that keeps the largest number of people comfortable and satisfied. The system's core technology, reinforcement learning, treats any manual adjustments by users as feedback, allowing it to continuously improve how it operates. This learning process reduces the need for people to make changes themselves.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
At home, we effortlessly control temperature, humidity, and lighting via smartphones. Yet, we lose this personalized control in shared spaces like offices and libraries. This raises a key question: ``Why can we manage our home environment meticulously, but not the public spaces where we spend most of our time?" This discrepancy highlights a significant technological gap in which individual comfort is sacrificed for one-size-fits-all management.

This environmental mismatch becomes a personal burden. Individuals in shared spaces often resort to passive measures, such as adding clothing or changing seats, when uncomfortable. This directly impacts not only their comfort but also their focus and productivity. We must therefore move beyond the current, unresponsive centralized control model to a new paradigm that can intelligently accommodate diverse and individual needs.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The fundamental flaw in shared environmental control is the requirement of enforcing a single setting on multiple individuals. This one-size-fits-all system cannot resolve the conflicting preferences that inevitably arise. Current feedback mechanisms, such as manual complaints, are inefficient, slow, and do not mediate these diverse needs. This leads directly to decreased comfort, reduced productivity, and energy waste. The core problem is the absence of an automated mechanism to intelligently mediate these conflicting demands and derive a balanced, optimal environment in real time.

\subsection{Related Service}

    \textbf{Siemens Comfy:} A leading workplace experience platform. It enables employees to adjust temperature and lighting in their immediate vicinity through an app. It also includes features like booking meeting rooms or desks. Its acquisition by Siemens highlights the trend of merging with smart building technology.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

    \textbf{HqO:} An integrated app platform that building owners provide to their tenants. It extends beyond simple environmental control to improve the overall 'work-life experience,' including booking building amenities, visitor registration, and viewing local information and announcements.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

    \textbf{Honeywell Forge:} An enterprise-level solution from Honeywell for optimizing building operations. Integrates data from various systems (HVAC, security, fire safety) for AI analysis to enable prediction of energy consumption and predictive maintenance. Its focus is more on operational efficiency than on employee-facing convenience.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

    \textbf{LG Electronics B2B Integrated Solutions:} LG provides B2B smart office solutions focused on central air conditioning (HVAC), digital signage, and meeting technologies. The key distinction is that these solutions have not yet integrated LG's consumer home appliances to provide personalized convenience for individual employees.


\section{Requirements}

\subsection{User Roles}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{General User:} Any individual present in a space where 'PocketHome' is installed. They register their unique ID via the app and transmit their personal environmental preferences to the system in real-time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Account Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Identification:}
User enters their unique \texttt{User ID} once, and can delete their profile with \texttt{User ID}.
After registration, the app stores the \texttt{User ID} on the device, allowing the user to transmit preferences without logging in each time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Features (Single Screen Interface)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single Screen UI:} All core functions (ID verification, preference input) are provided on a single main screen. It displays \texttt{User ID}, \texttt{Temperature}, \texttt{Humidity}, \texttt{Illumination (Brightness)} those can be manually changed, and other preferences such as \texttt{Optional Biometric Data Consent} button and so on.
\item \textbf{Real-time Update:} As soon as the user changes any of the three preference values (temperature, humidity, illumination), the new value is immediately sent with the \texttt{User ID} to the central database to be updated and stored.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optional Data Integration}
\subsubsection{Biometric Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Heart Rate Sensor:} With user consent, integrates with the smartphone's heart rate sensor (on compatible devices).
    \item \textbf{Blood Oxygen Sensor (SpO2):} With user consent, integrates with the smartphone's blood oxygen saturation sensor (on compatible devices).
    \item \textbf{Real-time Transmission:} When activated, periodically transmits the real-time measured heart rate data along with the \texttt{User ID} to the central database.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Personal Profile Attributes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optional Input:} Allows users to voluntarily provide additional personal attributes, such as MBTI type, self-assessed sensitivity to cold/light, or general work patterns (e.g., ``Focus work", ``Collaborative work").
    \item \textbf{Data Utilization:} This supplementary, non-biometric data can be used by the AI model as another feature to find correlations and improve the accuracy of its satisfaction predictions (e.g., ``Users with MBTI type `INXX' may correlate with a preference for lower illumination").
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System \& Space Integration}
\subsubsection{Presence Detection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network Communication:} When a user enters a specific `PocketHome' enabled zone, their smartphone begins communication with the local network (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Beacon).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Preference Transmission}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interval-based Communication:} While in space, the smartphone transmits its \texttt{User ID} and current preference data to the local space system at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes). This allows the space system to identify in real-time which users (User IDs) with which preferences are currently present in this space.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Utilization (AI Core)}
\subsubsection{Central AI Model (Multi-Objective Optimization)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Aggregation:} The central AI system queries the database to retrieve two key data sets: (1) All users' registered preferences (from Data Synchronization) and (2) The list of \texttt{User ID}s currently present in a specific zone (from Preference Transmission).
    \item \textbf{Optimization Goal:} The AI model (e.g., using Genetic Algorithms or MORL) processes this aggregated data. Its goal is to compute the single optimal environmental setting (temp, humidity, illumination) that best satisfies a defined objective function (e.g., the `Max-Min' principle, maximizing the satisfaction of the least-satisfied user).
    \item \textbf{Control Command:} The resulting optimal setting is then sent as a command to the building's control system (e.g., HVAC, lighting controllers) for that specific zone.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reinforcement Learning Feedback Loop}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monitoring for Manual Overrides:} The system must log any manual adjustments made by users (e.g., via a physical thermostat or an admin override) after the AI has set an environment.
    \item \textbf{Model Refinement:} A manual override is treated as strong negative feedback (``penalty"). The AI's reinforcement learning component uses this feedback to retrain its models, refining its understanding of true user preferences and discomfort thresholds to avoid this outcome in the future.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform:} Mobile application (Android).
    \item \textbf{Database:} A central, real-time database capable of receiving and updating all user \texttt{User IDs} and their changing preference data.
    \item \textbf{Network:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Central:} Stable internet connection (Wi-Fi or Cellular) for database updates.
            \item \textit{Local:} Local communication protocol (Bluetooth LE or Wi-Fi) for the detection and transmission of user presence within a space.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Privacy \& Consent:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Initial Consent:} A clear notification and consent process is mandatory upon \texttt{User ID} registration regarding the collection of preference and optional data.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Development Environment}

\subsection{Software Development Platform}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Windows}\par
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{Windows.jpg}
        \centering
        \caption{Windows} 
        \end{figure}\par
    Windows 11 was selected as the primary developer operating system due to its robust and high-performance support for the project's essential toolchain. Its main role is to host Android Studio, enabling the stable compilation, debugging, and emulation of the native Kotlin application. This environment allows for efficient build management via Gradle and simultaneously supports the local development and testing of the Python-based AI Core services before their eventual deployment to the Firebase cloud.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Programming Language}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kotlin}\par
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{Kotlin.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Kotlin} 
        \end{figure}\par
    Kotlin was chosen primarily because it is Google's official, modern language for native Android development, ensuring the best integration with Android Studio and safer, more concise code through features like null safety. Most importantly, it provides the direct and reliable access to the native SDKs essential for this project's core functionality—specifically, the Bluetooth LE (BLE) API for Presence Detection and the Health Connect API for Biometric Data Transmission—guaranteeing a level of performance and hardware compatibility that cross-platform tools cannot reliably offer.\\[1em]
    \item \textbf{Python}\par
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{Python.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Python}
        \end{figure}\par
    Python was chosen to power the server-side Data Utilization (AI Core) because it is the definitive industry standard for the complex AI modeling this project requires. Its primary role is to execute the Multi-Objective Optimization (MOP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models that form the system's intelligence. This decision leverages Python's unparalleled ecosystem of mature libraries, such as Pymoo for optimization and TensorFlow Agents for reinforcement learning, which are essential for processing aggregated user data. This stack enables a flexible architecture where heavy model training (using feedback logs) is performed offline, while the resulting optimized models are deployed to a serverless environment (like Google Cloud Run) for efficient real-time inference.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Software in Use}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Android Studio}\par
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.6\columnwidth]{AndroidStudio.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Android Studio} 
        \end{figure}\par
    Android Studio was selected as the development environment because its unmatched synergy with Kotlin, Google's official and primary language for the platform, which provides a seamless, optimized development experience that enhances code stability and accelerates production. Critically, this choice guarantees 100\% compatibility with essential native Android SDKs, allowing for the reliable, direct integration of core hardware-centric features like the Bluetooth LE (BLE) API for Presence Detection and the Health Connect API for Biometric Data Transmission through its integrated Gradle system, thereby avoiding the limitations often encountered when using cross-platform frameworks.\\[1em]
    \item \textbf{Flutter}\par
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.3\columnwidth]{Flutter.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Flutter} 
        \end{figure}\par
    Flutter was chosen for its ability to deliver a high-fidelity, consistent UI across both Android and iOS from a single codebase. Its rich, declarative widget system allows for deep customization and rapid prototyping. This speed is accelerated by Hot Reload, enabling instant testing and refinement of the Preference Input Dashboard. This method ensures a polished user experience and avoids duplicating design efforts for each platform.\\[1em]
    \item \textbf{Firebase}\par
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{Firebase.png}
        \centering
        \caption{Firebase} 
        \end{figure}\par
    Firebase was selected as the backend stack due to its direct alignment with the project's core requirements and its seamless integration with the native Kotlin app. Its Cloud Firestore component provides the essential real-time database capability specified in the Data Synchronization requirement, allowing for instantaneous preference updates from the app with minimal latency. Furthermore, Firebase's serverless architecture, through Cloud Functions, is ideal for executing the Data Utilization (AI Core) logic, enabling scalable, event-driven inference for our MOP/RL models. This comprehensive platform, combined with the cost-free prototyping offered by the Spark Plan and a robust Kotlin SDK, makes it the most rapid and efficient solution for development.\par
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cost Estimation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software Costs: \$0.} All primary development tools are free (Android Studio, Kotlin, Git, VS Code).
    \item \textbf{Cloud Costs (Prototype): \$0.} We will utilize the \textbf{Firebase (GCP) Free Tier (Spark Plan)}. This plan provides sufficient capacity for the \texttt{Cloud Firestore} database (real-time data sync) and \texttt{Cloud Functions} (API/AI logic) needed for development and initial testing.
    \item \textbf{Hardware Costs: \$0.} Development will use existing laptops (PC/Mac) and Android test devices.
\end{itemize}
